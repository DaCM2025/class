::: callout-note
**Today‚Äôs goals**
1. Understand course scope & expectations  
2. See why **reproducibility** matters  
3. Meet the core **toolchain** (R, Python, SQL, GitHub, Markdown/Jupyter/Quarto)  
4. Try small, focused **exercises**
:::

---

## Agenda

1. Course overview & evaluation  
2. Reproducibility in analytics  
3. Core tools & workflows  
4. Mini‚Äëexercises (static snippets)  

*Tip:* Slides include short activities you can try during/after class.

---

## Course Overview

- Orientation: **hands‚Äëon data & code practices** for analytics
- You will:
  - write clean **R/Python** code
  - query data via **SQL**
  - document with **Markdown/Jupyter/Quarto**
  - use **Git/GitHub** (branches, PRs, issues)
  - deliver a **reproducible project** (group)
- We value: clarity, collaboration, curiosity

::: callout-tip
**Success checklist**
- Commit early, commit often
- Make small, reversible changes
- Automate what repeats
- Document decisions, not only code
- Prefer scripts & notebooks over manual clicks
:::

---

## Expectations & Evaluation

- **Participation:** engaged presence, Slack questions/answers
- **Homeworks:** short, targeted (programming, SQL, tooling)
- **Project:** real‚Äëworld style, **reproducible** deliverable
- **Academic integrity:** cite sources, no copy‚Äëpaste answers

**Tools allowed:** R, Python, SQL, Quarto, GitHub, AI copilots (with provenance & verification).

::: callout-important
**AI policy (short)**  
Use AI to brainstorm, outline, or lint code. **Own** the result: verify outputs, write your tests, and **document** AI assistance (what, why, where).
:::

---

## Reproducibility: Why it matters

**Symptoms of non‚Äëreproducible work** (raise your hand if you've seen these):  
- ‚ÄúIt works on my machine.‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúI changed nothing and it broke.‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúWhich file is the final_final_v3.R?‚Äù

**Principles**  
- Deterministic environments  
- Versioned code **and** data contracts  
- Scripts, not clicks  
- Single‚Äësource of truth (parameters, config)  
- Literate programming (Markdown/Quarto)  
- Automated checks (CI later in course)

---

## Minimal Project Structure

```
project/
‚îú‚îÄ data/           # raw/ and processed/ (never overwrite raw)
‚îú‚îÄ R/ or src/      # functions, modules
‚îú‚îÄ notebooks/      # exploratory analysis
‚îú‚îÄ reports/        # Quarto/Markdown outputs
‚îú‚îÄ tests/          # unit tests
‚îú‚îÄ renv/ or .venv/ # R or Python environment
‚îú‚îÄ .gitignore
‚îî‚îÄ README.md
```

::: callout-note
**Exercise (2‚Ä≤ thinking):**  
What would you add for your domain (e.g., `sql/`, `fig/`, `configs/`)? Jot down 2 items.
:::

---

## Tooling Map

- **R** (tidyverse, data.table) & **Python** (pandas, polars)
- **SQL** for data retrieval/joins/aggregations
- **Git** + **GitHub** for versioning & collaboration
- **Markdown/Jupyter/Quarto** for literate workflows
- Optional helpers: **make**, **pre-commit**, **linters**

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**R snippet**
```r
# Vectorized transform
library(dplyr)
set.seed(42)
df <- tibble(x = rnorm(5), y = rnorm(5))
df |>
  mutate(z = x + y, grp = if_else(z > 0, "pos", "neg"))
```
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Python snippet**
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
rng = np.random.default_rng(42)
df = pd.DataFrame({"x": rng.normal(size=5), "y": rng.normal(size=5)})
df.assign(z=lambda d: d.x + d.y,
          grp=lambda d: np.where(d.z > 0, "pos", "neg"))
```
:::
:::

---

## SQL Refresher (we‚Äôll go deeper later)

```sql
-- Top customers by revenue
SELECT c.customer_id, SUM(o.amount) AS revenue
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o USING (customer_id)
WHERE o.order_date >= DATE '2025-01-01'
GROUP BY c.customer_id
ORDER BY revenue DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

::: callout-tip
**Tip:** Keep SQL in `.sql` files and load/parametrise from R/Python for reproducibility.
:::

---

## Git in 6 commands

```bash
git status
git add -A
git commit -m "Explain what/why, not how"
git pull --rebase
git push
git switch -c feature/your-topic   # create a feature branch
```

::: callout-note
**Activity (think‚Äëpair‚Äëshare):**  
What makes a good commit message? Write one for ‚Äúfixed weird bug in script‚Äù that would help your future self.
:::

---

## Literate Programming with Quarto

- Write text + code together
- Render to HTML/PDF/slides/reports
- Parametrized reports & caching
- Works with **R** and **Python**

```markdown
```{r}
#| label: fig-scatter
#| fig-cap: "A quick scatterplot"
plot(mtcars$wt, mtcars$mpg)
```
```

Render:
```bash
quarto render report.qmd
```
  
::: callout-important
**House rule:** every analysis step appears in a script/notebook‚Äîno manual spreadsheet edits.
:::

---

## Environments (determinism)

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**R ‚Äî renv**
```r
install.packages("renv")
renv::init()
renv::snapshot()   # lock versions
renv::restore()    # reproduce elsewhere
```
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Python ‚Äî venv + requirements**
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
:::
:::

::: callout-note
**Exercise (1‚Ä≤):** List one package you rely on in R and in Python. Why lock its version?
:::

---

## Data Contracts & File Hygiene

- Never overwrite **raw/** data
- Validate schemas (columns, types, keys)
- Record data provenance (source, timestamp)
- Use `.gitignore` to avoid committing large/secret files

```gitignore
# data & local env
data/raw/*
!.gitkeep
.venv/
renv/library/
*.sqlite
*.parquet
```

---

## Quick Wins You Can Adopt Today

- Create a project with folders from the template earlier
- Initialize **Git** and push to **GitHub**
- Set up **renv** or **.venv**
- Convert one analysis to **Quarto**

::: callout-tip
**Stretch goal:** Add a small test (R `testthat` or Python `pytest`) for a helper function you wrote.
:::

---

## Mini‚ÄëExercise 1 (R)

**Objective:** Write a function and test it quickly.

```r
# R: rolling mean for a numeric vector
roll_mean <- function(x, k = 3) {
  stopifnot(is.numeric(x), k >= 1, k == as.integer(k))
  stats::filter(x, rep(1/k, k), sides = 2)
}

# quick check
x <- 1:7
roll_mean(x, k = 3)
```

*Discussion:* How would you handle NA edges?

---

## Mini‚ÄëExercise 2 (Python)

**Objective:** Clean a small dataset and compute a grouped metric.

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.DataFrame({
    "team": ["A","A","B","B","B"],
    "score": [10, None, 9, 12, 13]
}).assign(score=lambda d: d.score.fillna(d.score.median()))
df.groupby("team", as_index=False)["score"].mean()
```

*Discussion:* Where would assertions / schema checks go?

---

## Mini‚ÄëExercise 3 (SQL)

**Objective:** Translate a business question into SQL.

> *‚ÄúWhich products grew the most month‚Äëover‚Äëmonth in 2025?‚Äù*

```sql
WITH monthly AS (
  SELECT product_id,
         DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date) AS month,
         SUM(amount) AS revenue
  FROM orders
  WHERE order_date >= DATE '2025-01-01'
  GROUP BY product_id, DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date)
),
growth AS (
  SELECT product_id, month,
         revenue,
         LAG(revenue) OVER (PARTITION BY product_id ORDER BY month) AS prev_revenue
  FROM monthly
)
SELECT product_id, month, revenue, prev_revenue,
       (revenue - prev_revenue) AS delta
FROM growth
WHERE prev_revenue IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY delta DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

---

## Collaboration Rituals

- Branch ‚Üí small PR ‚Üí peer review ‚Üí merge
- Use **Issues** with labels (‚Äúbug‚Äù, ‚Äúenhancement‚Äù, ‚Äúquestion‚Äù)
- Templates: `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`, `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md`
- Document **decisions** in `CHANGELOG.md`

::: callout-note
**Activity:** In pairs, outline a PR description for adding a new `utils/plot.R` with one function and one test.
:::

---

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid Them

- Undocumented notebooks ‚Üí add titles, goals, outputs
- Hidden state (globals) ‚Üí pass parameters explicitly
- One giant script ‚Üí split into modules
- No seeds ‚Üí set seeds where randomness matters
- Unpinned packages ‚Üí lock versions

---

## What‚Äôs Next

- **Next lecture:** Programming foundations (R & Python)
- **Before next time:** ensure you can
  1. clone a GitHub repo,
  2. create a branch & commit,
  3. render a Quarto `.qmd` to HTML,
  4. set up `renv` **or** `.venv`.

::: callout-tip
If stuck: ask on **Slack**‚Äîshow error, steps tried, and minimal example.
:::

---

## Q&A

Thanks!  
*Optional:* After class, try converting one old analysis to **Quarto** and push it to GitHub with a short README.

- **Comprehensive packages**: Tools like `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, and `tidyverse` make data manipulation and visualization a breeze.
- **Cutting-edge techniques**: Stay ahead with powerful tools for machine learning, statistical modeling, and data mining.


---

### 2. **Ideal for Business Analytics**
- **Advanced Statistical Methods**: R has a wide range of libraries to handle complex business data.
- **Visualization Powerhouse**: Create stunning, customized visualizations that help tell compelling business stories.
- **Report Generation**: With `RMarkdown` and `Shiny`, you can create automated reports and interactive dashboards for decision-making.

---

### 3. **Supported by a Strong Community**
- **Open-source and free**: R is continually evolving with contributions from data scientists worldwide.
- **Active Community**: Get access to countless tutorials, forums, and resources to grow your skills.
  
---

### 4. **Integration Capabilities**
- Seamlessly integrate R with other languages and tools (e.g., Python, SQL, Excel, Tableau).
- R fits well into a larger business workflow, making it perfect for **end-to-end analytics solutions**.


---
## Brief histo`R`y
* `R` is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics;
* It was developed around 1995 by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, as an alternative implementation of the basic `S` language developed by John Chambers and colleagues;
* Oldest release (available) is version 0.49 (1997-04-23)

```{r,echo=FALSE,fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(path="images/extending_r.png")
```


---
## Main featu`R`es
* Much code written for `S` runs unaltered under `R`;
* `R` provides a variety of statistical and graphical techniques;
* `R` is popular for data science (in competition with Python);
* `R` is open-source;
* `R` is an interpreted language;
* `R` is highly extensible via packages (more than 20,000 available on CRAN); 
* `R` can be interfaced with other languages (C++, Fortran, ...).

---
## `R` is an interpreted language
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/cartoon_programming.png")
```

---
## Compiled program

- Program is translated into native machine instruction (compilation)

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width=750, out.height=111}
knitr::include_graphics("images/compiled.png")
```

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width=750, out.height=117}
knitr::include_graphics("images/compiled_pl.png")
```

---
## Interpreted program

- Program is translated into another code (bytecode). An interpreter then performs the required actions.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width=750, out.height=111}
knitr::include_graphics("images/interpreted.png")
```

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width=750, out.height=117}
knitr::include_graphics("images/interpreted_pl.png")
```

---
## `R` interfaces to other languages
`R` is basically written in `C` and `Fortran`. Available interfaces to other languages comprise:
- `C` via `.Call()` function
- `Fortran` via `.Fortran()` function
- `C++` via the `Rcpp` package
- `Python` via `reticulate`, `rPython`, `rJython` or `XRPython`
- `Julia` via `XRJulia`
- `JavaScript` via `V8`
- `Excel`, `JSON`, `SQL`, `Perl`, ...


See Chambers, (2017) for a comprehensive discussion on interfacing `R`.

## What are LLMs?

- **Definition**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are AI models trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human language.
  
- **Examples**: 
  - GPT-3, GPT-4 (OpenAI)
  - Gemini (Google)
  - LLaMA (Meta)
  - Claude (Anthropic)

- **Capabilities**:
  - Natural language understanding and generation
  - Text completion, summarization, translation
  - Assistance in various domains, including **programming**.

---

**Why are they important for programming?**
- LLMs can understand code as a special type of language.
- They offer assistance in code generation, debugging, and improving programming productivity.

---
## LLM for Programming

**Key Features**:
1. **Code Suggestions**: 
   - Automates repetitive coding tasks.
   - Helps in writing boilerplate code.
   - See for instance GitHub's copilot.

2. **Error Debugging**: 
   - Identifies and resolves bugs in code snippets.
   - Suggests alternative solutions or optimizations.

3. **Code Explanation**: 
   - Breaks down complex code into simple explanations.
   - Helps in learning new programming concepts.

---
## Benefits of Using LLMs like ChatGPT in Programming

#### **1. Increased Productivity**
- Automates repetitive and boilerplate tasks.
- Helps explore new coding approaches faster.

#### **2. Learning and Discovery**
- Explains code, libraries, and new languages in an intuitive manner.
- Great for beginners and advanced users alike.

---

## Challenges and Considerations

#### **1. Not Always Correct**
- LLMs can suggest incorrect code, requiring human oversight.

#### **2. Context Limitations**
- LLMs lack the full project context, so they might not understand the specific requirements.

#### **3. Ethical Concerns**
- Intellectual property, security, and data privacy must be considered when using AI for programming.

## What is RMarkdown? 
<img src="images/markdown.png" style="width:150px; position:absolute; top:7%; left:45%" /> 

* RMarkdown: `R` + `markdown`
* `markdown` contrasts `markup` languages (e.g. HTML) which require syntax that can be quite difficult to decipher for the uninitiated
* RMarkdown is a framework that provides a literate programming format for data science.
* **Literate programming**: programmers add narrative context with code to produce documentation for the program simultaneously.
* **Reproducible research**: the whole process (collecting data, performing analysis, producing output,...) can be reproduced the same way by someone else.

---
## What is RMarkdown? 

> In a nutshell, R Markdown stands on the shoulders of knitr and Pandoc. The former executes the computer code embedded in Markdown, and converts R Markdown to Markdown. The latter renders Markdown to the output format you want (such as PDF, HTML, Word, and so on).
.right[-- <cite>R Markdown: The Definitive Guide</cite>]

---
## Important features of `markdown`

* Three aspect: YAML metadata, text, code chunks

---
## Important features of `markdown`
### 1. YAML Ain't Markup Language

* Head of the document where options are defined.
* Surrounded by `---`
* Options comprises: author, date, output format, table of content, themes, code folding, ...

---
## Important features of `markdown`
### 2. Text

* Core body, essential for explaining your analysis. 
* Markdown syntax comprises:  
  * emphasis (*&ast;italics&ast;*, **&ast;&ast;bold&ast;&ast;**, or &grave;`code style`&grave;)  
  * headers (# ## ###)
  * lists (* - + for unnumbered and 1. for numbered)   
  * hyperlinks (<> ()[])
  * blockquotes (>)
  * picture/gif ( !()[])

### 2. Text
* $\LaTeX$ in RMarkdown using the syntax `$math expression$`
* Cross-referencing sections using syntax `\@ref(label)`
* Citations and bibliographies can automatically be generated with RMarkdown
* **You can always use HTML**

## Important features of `RMarkdown`
### 3. Code Chunks 

Code chunks are specific to `RMarkdown`. It allows to embed `R` code within your document.

To insert these chunks within your RMarkdown file, use either:
- the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Alt + I (OS X: Cmd + Option + I)
- the Add Chunk command in the editor toolbar
- by typing the chunk delimiters ` ```{r label, some option}` and ` ``` `   

---
## Important features of `RMarkdown`
### 3. Code Chunks 
Most common chunk options: 

- `eval`: (TRUE; logical) whether to evaluate the code chunk;
- `echo`: (TRUE; logical or numeric) whether to include R source code in the output file;
- `warning`: (TRUE; logical) whether to preserve warnings (produced by warning()) in the output like we run R code in a terminal (if FALSE, all warnings will be printed in the console instead of the output document);
- `cache`: (FALSE; logical) whether to "*cache*" a code chunk. It may be convenient to avoid re-running the computations and save time.
- `dependson`: (label) allows to refer to objects in other chunk.

## Important features of `RMarkdown`
### 3. Code Chunks 
Plot figure options: 

- `fig.path`: ('figure/'; character) prefix to be used for figure filenames (fig.path and chunk labels are concatenated to make filenames);
- `fig.show`: ('asis'; character) how to show/arrange the plots;
- `fig.width`, `fig.height`: (both are 7; numeric) width and height of the plot, to be used in the graphics device (in inches) and have to be numeric;
- `fig.align`: ('default'; character) alignment of figures in the output document (possible values are left, right and center;
- `fig.cap`: (NULL; character) figure caption to be used in a figure environment.

## From RMarkdown to Quarto
<img src="images/quarto.png" style="width:250px; position:absolute; top:9%; left:55%" /> 
- Similar to RMarkdown, it can render docs that contain code in R, Python, Julia,... 
- It combines functionalities of RMarkdown and other packages into a **single system**, very useful to collaborate with people who write in a different programming language from you (and do not necessarily have R/R Studio).

> Like R Markdown, Quarto uses Knitr to execute R code, and is therefore able to render most existing Rmd files without modification.

## GitHub
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width=950, out.height=450}

```

---
## Motivation

* When working on a project, there are usually different people working on the same file/folder
* You want to avoid sending each modification by email
* You could use dropbox/google drive and the likes but it is good practice to keep track of modifications and have a platform to plan and discuss changes

---
## Motivation

GitHub allows you:
- record the entire history of a file;
- revert to a specific version of the file;
- collaborate on the same platform with other people;
- make changes without modifying the main file and add them once you feel comfortable with them.

---
## Motivation

GitHub will be used for:
- work in group on projects and homeworks;
- submit projects/homeworks;
- develop R packages and website;
- ...

## In fact, what is Git?
<img src="images/git.png" style="width:150px; position:absolute; top:9%; left:40%" /> 

Git is a **distributed version control system**.

* **distributed**: whenever you instruct Git to share files, Git does not only share the latest file version, but instead, it distributes **every version** it has recorded for that project.

* **version control system**: many people are used to have *their own version control system* e.g. by having different versions of the same file (`file_v1.R`, `file_v2.R`, ...). This approach is error-prone and ineffective when working in team project. Thus, a version control system keeps track of changes to modification in your project.

---
## Types of VCS
There are three types of version control system (VCS):
* local
* centralized
* distributed

---
## Types of VCS
### Local

.pull-left[
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width=451, out.height=300}
knitr::include_graphics("images/local_vcs.jpg")
```
]

.pull-right[
* One of the simplest and most commonly used VCS
* It keeps patch sets (modification of a file) locally (on your computer)
* It can recreate the file at any point in time by adding up the patches
]

---
## Types of VCS
### Centralized

.pull-left[
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width=490, out.height=317}
knitr::include_graphics("images/centralized_vcs.png")
```
]

.pull-right[
* A single server contains all the versioned files
* Risk of failure
* Risk of database corruption
]

---
## Types of VCS
### Distributed
.pull-left[
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width=460, out.height=416}
knitr::include_graphics("images/dst_vcs.jpg")
```
]

.pull-right[
* Store the entire history of files locally
* Sync local changes back to server
* Allow multiple users and minimize risks of centralized VCS
]

---
## Benefits of VCS
* Allow multiple users to collaborate and communicate while working on a project.
* Keep tracks of the change history of the files (risk mitigation) with possibility to roll back to previous version.
* Different workflows such as branching and merging (not discussed)

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width=410, out.height=250}
knitr::include_graphics("images/branching.jpeg")
```

---
## So Git and GitHub are the same things?

</center>

---
## Git vs GitHub
Git is a distributed VCS, so what is GitHub exactly?

* Git is a software...
* ...and GitHub is web-based plateform for software development and version control that uses Git.
* GitHub hosts and shares Git repository.
* GitHub is not the only service provider

#BitBucket
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/bitbucket.png")
```

---
#GitLab
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/gitlab.png")
```

---
#SourceForge
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/sourceforge.png")
```

## Okay to continue ?

## Files states in Git
A file can have different states: **untracked**, **modified**, **staged** or **committed**

* **untracked**: a new file that is not tracked by Git (yet);
* **modified**: a tracked file which is modified but not recorded (not committed yet);
* **staged**: a tracked file which is modified and that has been selected to be saved (committed) into the repository during the next commit snapshot;
* **committed**: a file that is successfully recorded into the (local) repository.

---
## Files states in Git
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/git-basic-workflow-codesweetly.png")
```

---
## you can also `.gitignore`
* Some files or folders of your project can be excluded from version control by specifying `.gitignore`
* These files or folders will not be shared to other users

```{r, fig.align="center", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path="images/gitignore.png")
```


---
## GitHub
### Basic workflow

The basic workflow is as follows...

1. Open the RStudio Project connected to your Git(Hub) Repo
2. Work on your computer just like always
3. **Save** your work often just like always
4. When you want to preserve a **snapshot** of your project, you make a "commit"
5. When you have a few commits and want to archive them, you "push" them to the GitHub remote server
6. If you decide to work from a different computer, or want to pick up where a collaborator left off, you can "pull" the most up-to-date version of the files from the GitHub remote to your local computer and go back to step 2.

## GitHub
### New habits
* When you want to preserve a **snapshot** of your project, you make a "commit."
* When you have a few commits and want to archive them, you "push" them to the GitHub remote server.
* If you decide to work from a different computer, or want to pick up where a collaborator left off, you can "pull" the most up-to-date version of the files from the GitHub remote to your local computer.

## GitHub
### Commits
Make your commit message as informative and concise as possible.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width=439, out.height=250}
knitr::include_graphics("images/git_commit.png")
```

---
## GitHub
### "pull" before you "push"
Make sure you have the up-to-date version of your project before working on it.

Try to avoid the headaches of "merge conflict".

## GitHub
### Common mistakes (and how to solve them)

* **Commits in the wrong Repo**. Nothing seems to work? It's a common mistake. Solution: make sure you work on the correct RStudio project that is correctly linked to GitHub.

* **Large files error**. GitHub blocks pushes that exceed 100 MB. Solution: find another solution for large files (Dropbox, ...)

* **Conflict (not merge)**. Conflicts may happen when two collaborators make different changes to part of a program at the same time but on different lines of code. One of them push the modification to the remote. The second one to push will have a conflict as his/her version of the project is "outdated". Solution: `git pull --rebase`

* **Merge conflict**. It happens when two collaborators work on the same lines of code at the same time. It is often a problem of miscommunication within groups and lack of organization. Solution: To resolve these conflicts, we must directly edit the documents making sure potential conflicts are discussed before pushing.
